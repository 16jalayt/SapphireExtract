# SapphireExtract
A java program that can extract from a variety of game formats.

This program is in the process of being cleaned up and developed. The modules might be broken or incomplete. If you encounter any problems, please submit a bug report so I can improve the software. This program is a passion project and will be updated when I have time. This is my first publicly shared program, so please give me feedback.

Bleeding edge releases are available in the dev directory. These are updated every commit. The release tab will be updated infrequently.
